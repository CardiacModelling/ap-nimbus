appredict-chaste-libs
=========================

|appredict-chaste-libs| is a container which contains all of |ApPredict|\ 's library dependencies.

 * Conventionally |appredict-chaste-libs| isn't installed as it's just a collection of
   |ApPredict| dependencies compiled from source code and as such just the foundation for
   |appredict-no-emulators| to build on.
 * There's no "running" of |appredict-chaste-libs|.
